# A personal library application
library-project is an intuitive application that allows the user to add, edit, and delete books from a list. Books can be sorted by Title, Author, or Date Added, and are generated with a randomized color palette.
All data is automatically pushed to localStorage, so that the user can resume their session after coming back to the page.
